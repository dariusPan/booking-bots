# üßæ Booking Bot

**Booking Bot** is an automation tool built with **Python** and **Selenium** to automate booking tasks on a target website. It simulates human interaction to fill out forms, click buttons, and complete reservation processes automatically.

This bot is designed for flexibility and can run manually or on a schedule (can run daily). It is cross-platform and can be configured easily using a `.env` file for environment-specific settings such as login credentials and booking preferences.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Google Chrome
- ChromeDriver (matching your Chrome version)
- Virtual environment recommended

## üîê Using the `.env` File

All sensitive data like usernames, passwords, and URLs are managed through a `.env` file. See .env.example file.

### Example `.env`

- USERNAME="myusername@xx.com"
- PASSWORD="mypassword"
- BDATE = '2025-05-19'
- TSTART = '830pm' # Booking time start
- TEND = '930pm'   # Booking time end
- SCHEDULE_DATE = "2025-06-30"  # Format: YYYY-MM-DD
- SCHEDULE_TIME = "14:29"  # Format: HH:MM (24-hour) Set 1 minute before when you want to run the bot
